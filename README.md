# Free-Range
Free-Range is an NCurses filesystem viewer written in Chicken Scheme. 

Current Issues:
- Crashes upon entering and empty directory
- Scrolling to the end of large directories causes crashes

Next Steps:
- Remove globals
- Show directory structure one level above working directory at the left
- Add color
